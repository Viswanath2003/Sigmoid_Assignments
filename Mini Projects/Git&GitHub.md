    - Initialize with README, .gitignore (Python template), and LICENSE
    - Create proper folder structure:
        
        ```
        dataops-pipeline-demo/├── data/│   ├── raw/│   ├── processed/│   └── staging/├── scripts/│   ├── extraction/│   ├── transformation/│   └── loading/├── configs/├── tests/├── docs/└── deployments/
        
        ```
        
2. **Branching Strategy Implementation**
    - Create branches: `develop`, `staging`, `production`
    - Create feature branch: `feature/data-validation-pipeline`
    - Implement GitFlow methodology for DataOps
3. **Documentation**
    - Write comprehensive README.md with:
        - Project overview
        - Setup instructions
        - Branching strategy explanation
        - Data pipeline architecture diagram (text-based)

### Key Learning Outcomes

### Objective

Simulate a collaborative DataOps environment with multiple contributors working on data pipelines.

### Tasks

1. **Create Multi-Stage Data Pipeline**
    - Write Python scripts for:
        - `extract_data.py` - Simulate data extraction from API/database
        - `transform_data.py` - Data cleaning and transformation
        - `validate_data.py` - Data quality checks
        - `load_data.py` - Simulate loading to data warehouse
2. **Configuration Management**
    - Create `config.yaml` with database connections, API endpoints
    - Add environment-specific configs: `dev.yaml`, `staging.yaml`, `prod.yaml`
    - Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive data
3. **Collaborative Workflow Simulation**
    - Create multiple feature branches:
        - `feature/add-data-validation`
        - `feature/improve-error-handling`
        - `feature/add-logging`
    - Make commits with proper DataOps commit messages
    - Create and merge pull requests with code review comments
4. **Conflict Resolution**
    - Intentionally create merge conflicts in configuration files
    - Practice resolving conflicts in data pipeline code

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Git workflow for data pipeline development
- Handling configuration files and secrets
- Collaborative development practices
- Merge conflict resolution

## Project 3: Data Quality & Testing with Git Hooks

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

**Difficulty**: Intermediate-Advanced

### Objective

Implement automated data quality checks using Git hooks and GitHub Actions basics.

### Tasks

1. **Pre-commit Hooks Setup**
    - Install and configure pre-commit framework
    - Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with:
        - Python code formatting (black, flake8)
        - YAML validation
        - Data file size checks
        - Sensitive data detection
2. **Data Quality Scripts**
    - Write `data_quality_checks.py`:
        - Schema validation
        - Data type checking
        - Null value detection
        - Duplicate record identification
    - Create unit tests using pytest
3. **Git History for Data Lineage**
    - Create commits that track data transformation steps
    - Use descriptive commit messages for data lineage tracking
    - Tag releases for different data pipeline versions
4. **Documentation**
    - Create `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
        - Development setup instructions
        - Code quality standards
        - Testing requirements
        - Data handling guidelines

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Automated quality checks in data workflows
- Git hooks for DataOps
- Data lineage tracking through version control
- Professional project documentation

## Project 4: GitHub Actions for DataOps CI/CD

**Duration**: 3-4 hours

**Difficulty**: Advanced

### Objective

Implement basic CI/CD pipeline for data projects using GitHub Actions.

### Tasks

1. **Basic CI Pipeline**
    - Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
    - Implement workflow for:
        - Code linting and formatting checks
        - Unit test execution
        - Data quality validation
        - Dependency security scanning
2. **Data Pipeline Testing**
    - Create sample data files in `tests/fixtures/`
    - Write integration tests that:
        - Test complete data pipeline execution
        - Validate data transformation logic
        - Check output data quality
    - Mock external dependencies (databases, APIs)
3. **Environment Management**
    - Create environment-specific workflows
    - Use GitHub Secrets for configuration
    - Implement different deployment strategies per branch
4. **Monitoring & Notifications**
